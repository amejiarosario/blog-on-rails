  body_value: "<p>Search Engine Optimizations (SEO) could be quite challenging for beginners. It's overwhelming the amount of information that a webmaster need to understand in order to make his websites visible, in search engines like Google, Bing, Yahoo, ... Moreover most of this information is quite disperse. The idea here is to provided all the needed information in one place. Starting from steps for all websites and then focusing on Drupal SEO modules. &nbsp; <strong>General Steps:</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li><strong>Sign up</strong>in the webmaster tools for the main search engines:\r\n		<ul>\r\n			<li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/webmasters/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\">Google Webmaster Tools</a></li>\r\n			<li><a href=\"siteexplorer.search.yahoo.com\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\">Yahoo!

There are several options in the verification process, as you can see in their websites. You can choose from: uploading a file to you web directory, or adding a text string in your host name, or adding a meta tag and other methods.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Metrics</strong>. Before&nbsp;optimizing&nbsp;your website you have to \"<strong>know your number</strong>\", so you can see if what you are doing is working. Your numbers are the amount of visitors, webpage clicked, top visitied pages. For that, there are free tools available, I have used the following ones.\r\n		<ol>\r\n			<li><a href=\"http://www.google.com/analytics/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\">Google Analytics</a>: it's a very good tool, provides a lot of information such as, number of visitors, top clicked pages, visitor's browsers, OS, screen resolution, ISP and more!</li>\r\n			<li><a href=\"http://www.webalizer.org/\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\">The Webalizer</a> is a free web server log file analysis program.

Every webmaster tool from the&nbsp;different&nbsp;search engines has their checklist and guidelines. Go through them (in the future, I will post a summary here)</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><strong>Drupal Modules</strong> Read <a href=\"http://yadadrop.com/services/drupal-seo-modules-search-engine-optimization\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\">here</a> for now (I will make my own list in the future)</p>\r\n"

  title: "Microsoft Zune Failure Analysis"
  created: 1312810976
  changed: 1312811054
  body_value: "All the Zune 30 froze, precisely at 12:01 A.M. on December 31, 2008. These devices got stuck with an irresponsive Zune logo. This bug that didn’t allow users to use the device was cause by a bug in the internal clock driver that handled improperly the last day of a year leap. The Zune 30 model 2006 was the only one affected by this bug; all the other models keep working ok, such as the Zune: 80 and 120 GB with hard drive, and 4, 8, 16 GB with flash drive, because they did not have the component with the error.\r\n\r\nAt the core of the Zune 30 music players, there is the Freescale iMX31L Multimedia processor and the MC13783 Power Management Chip. These components are also used in many other products like GPS, cellphones, pace makers, etc. Also the bug froze up the Toshiba Gigabeat S media players, since it was using the MC13783 chip. The driver written by Freescale for their MC13783 caused all of the problems in all the devices that were using it. The official solution from Microsoft to this bug was to let the Zune run out of battery completely, and reset it on January 1st. This bug was dissolved successfully by itself the first day of the 2009. \r\n\r\nSUGGESTED PRACTICES\r\n\r\nThe error occurred with the Microsoft’s Zune 30 could be avoided with effective test coverage. Microsoft and Toshiba relied in the correctness of the components of their supplier Freescale. But, all the components should not be considered reliable until they are properly tested. \r\n\r\nEven though, it is not practical to test all the possible alternatives, good unit testing should test representative input values using equivalent partitioning and boundary-value analysis. Equivalence partitioning is the testing technique that divides the possible inputs into different equivalent classes. All the possible inputs are classified and grouped in equivalent classes, which are a reduced representation of all the kinds of inputs possible and have produce similar outputs. After, the equivalent classes are identified; the cases are generated applying the boundary-value analysis. Since most of the errors in software are located in the boundaries, the boundary-value analysis is an effective technique for testing. Boundary testing is test cases where the inputs are generated from the maximum and minimum input domain, such as typical values, error values, special values, values just inside and outside the boundaries. \r\n\r\nAnother good practice that might have detected this problem is the use of peer reviews. The purpose of the peer review is to detect and correct defects in software artifacts, and prevent leakage into final product. In peer reviews, the author examined his own code and one or more developers also examined it. The colleges evaluate and make recommendations to author’s code. This not only favors error detection, but also the college’s suggestion might helps to refactor code and increase performance and quality. The described combination of testing techniques might have revealed the leap-year bug on time.\r\n\r\nENSURING PRODUCT LINES QUALITY\r\n\r\nThe Zune 30 was not the only product affected by the MC13783 Freescale’s driver’s bug. Also all the devices using this chip experienced the same problem. For instance, the Toshiba’s Gigabeat product line was affected as well. The bug also froze up their Toshiba Gigabeat S due the leap year.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Zune’s product line has the following products: Zune: 30, 80 and 120 GB with hard drive, and Zune 4, 8, 16 GB with flash drive.  The only one affected was the Zune 30, because it was the only one using the MC13783 component, which driver happen to had a bug. This individual variability in the product line was not correctly managed.\r\n\r\nSoftware product lines have the purposes of reduce costs, improve quality, and reduce time to market. These goals will be achieved only if the quality attributes are present since the beginning of the project. Testing product lines is one way for assuring quality attributes. Product lines tests vary in scope from involving the entire product line (common components) to specific product variabilities. \r\n\r\nThis study case reveals the importance of performing proper testing to the all the variables in a product line. A proper variability management is necessary to ensure the quality of all the products in a product line. All the variabilities, components and features that are varied, should be individually be tested, as well as the common components.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION \r\n\r\nThere are some lessons that can be learnt from the study case of the Zune 30 Failure. One is the importance of the unit tests coverage. Even 3rd-party component interfaces should be tested properly to verify its correctness. Testing techniques such as boundary-value analysis and equivalence classes can improve the quality of unit test and will increase the likelihood of catching bugs. The correct product line management is important too. Software product lines reduce costs, time to market and increase quality. Also, test to should be adapted to product lines. All the common components in a product line should be tested as well as the individual variabilities.\r\n\r\n"

  body_value: "<p>1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction</p>\r\n<p>Ruby on Rails (RoR) is open source web framework written in the Ruby programming language, and all the applications in Rails are written in Ruby. Ruby on Rails is focused on productivity and enforces agile web development.</p>\r\n<p>Rails framework leverages the features of the Ruby language. Yukishiro Matzumoto designed this language in 1995 influence by Perl, Eiffel, Python, Smalltalk and others. It’s a dynamically typed, fully object-oriented, general-purpose scripting language. Ruby was designed to have an elegant syntax and made as human readable as possible, for instance it does not need colons and parenthesis around parameters. Some parts of the code are read like English declarations.</p>\r\n<p>The Ruby on Rails framework was designed for database-backed web applications. It was created as a response to heavy web frameworks such as J2EE and the .NET framework. In order to make the development process faster, Ruby on Rails uses conventions and assumptions that are considered best ways to accomplish tasks, and it’s designed to encourage those. This convention eliminates configuration code and increases productivity. Many of the common tasks for web development are built-in in the framework to work out-of-the-box. This includes email management, object-database mappers, file structures, code generation, how the elements are named and organized and so on. All of these conventions allow developers to write less code and develop agile applications. Additionally, the enhance maintainability and understandability around the Ruby on Rails developers’ community.</p>\r\n<p>Ruby on Rails architecture has the following features:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Model-View-Controller architecture.</li>\r\n	<li>Representational State Transfer (REST) for web services.</li>\r\n	<li>Supports the major databases (MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL Server, PostgreSQL, IBM DB2, and more).</li>\r\n	<li>Open-source server side scripting language.</li>\r\n	<li>Convention over configuration</li>\r\n	<li>Scripts generators to automate tasks.</li>\r\n	<li>Use of YAML machine, which is a human-readable data serialization format.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The above-described features are distributed in the following Rails’ components and the Fig. 2 shows the interaction between some of these components:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Action Mailer</li>\r\n	<li>Action Pack\r\n		<ul style=\"list-style-type:circle;\">\r\n			<li>Action Controller</li>\r\n			<li>Action Dispatcher</li>\r\n			<li>Action View</li>\r\n		</ul>\r\n	</li>\r\n	<li>Active Model</li>\r\n	<li>Active Record</li>\r\n	<li>Active Resource</li>\r\n	<li>Active Support</li>\r\n	<li>Railties</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Ruby on Rails Architecture Diagram\" src=\"https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-qUDi3Wiv6A0/RwGSHOH-OWI/AAAAAAAAAEI/_WrLZZLVsR0/s640/Rails2.png\" style=\"width: 640px; height: 483px; \"></p>\r\n<p><strong>Figure 2. Reference model depicting the overall framework architecture [<a href=\"https://picasaweb.google.com/Dikiwinky/Ruby#5116531304417868130\">source</a>]</strong></p>\r\n<h2>1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model-View-Controller Pattern</h2>\r\n<p>Ruby on Rails uses the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern in order to improve the maintainability of the application. The Model centralizes the business logic, the View manages the display logic, while the Controller deals with the application flow. The MVC allows a clean separation of concerns, in the way that it keeps the business logic separated from HTML views. Additionally, it improves decoupling and testing.</p>\r\n<h3>1.1.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Model</h3>\r\n<p>The Model layer carries the business logic of the application and the rules to manipulate the data. In Ruby on Rails, the models are used to manage the interaction with their corresponding elements in the database. The Models represent the information in the database and do the appropriate validations.</p>\r\n<h3>1.1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; View</h3>\r\n<p>The view is the front-end of the application, representing the user interface. In Ruby on Rails, views are HTML files with embedded Ruby code. The embedded Ruby code in the HTMLs is fairly simple (loops and conditionals). It is only used to display data to the user in the form of views. Views are used to provide the data to the browsers that requested the web pages. Views can server content in several formats, such as HTML, PDF, XML, RSS and more.</p>\r\n<h3>1.1.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Controller</h3>\r\n<p>Controllers interact with models and views. The incoming requests from the browsers are processed by the controllers, which process the data from the models and pass it to the views for presentation.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h2>1.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rails Modules</h2>\r\n<h3>1.2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action Mailer</h3>\r\n<p>This module is responsible for providing e-mail services. It processes incoming mails and creates new ones. This module can handle simple text or complex rich-format emails. Also it has common tasks built-in, such as, sending out forgotten passwords, welcome messages, and fulfilling any other written-communication’s need. Action Mailer is wrapped around the Action Controller. It provides ways to make email with templates in the same way that Action View uses it to render web pages.</p>\r\n<h3>1.2.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Action Pack</h3>\r\n<p>The Action Pack module provides the controller and view layers of the MVC patterns. These modules capture the user requests made by the browser and map these requests to actions. These actions are defined in the controllers layer and later the actions render a view that is displayed in the browser. Action Pack is divided in 3 sub-modules, which are: Action Dispatch, Action Controller, and Action View.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li><strong>Action Dispatch:</strong> handles routing of web browser request. It parses the web request and does advanced processing around HTTP, such as handling cookies, sessions, request methods, and so forth.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Action Controller:</strong> after the action dispatch has processed the request it makes the routing to its corresponding controller. This module provides a base controller from which all the other controllers can inherit. Action Controller contains actions to controls model and view. This module makes data available as needed, controls views rendering and redirection. Additionally, it manages the user sessions, application flow, caching features, helper modules and implement filters for the pre, during and post processing hooks.</li>\r\n	<li><strong>Action View:</strong> it is call by the Action Controller. It renders the presentation of the web page requested. Action View provides master layouts, templates lookups and view helpers that assist the generation of the HTML, feeds and other presentation formats. There are three templates schemas in Rails, which are rhtml, rxml, and rjs. The rhtml format generates HTML views to the users with ERB (embedded ruby code in HTML). The rxml is used to construct XML documents using Ruby, and rjs allow creating dynamic JavaScript code in Ruby useful to implement AJAX functionality.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<h3>1.2.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Active Model</h3>\r\n<p>Define the interface between the Action Pack and the Active Record modules. Also, Action Record interfaces can be used outside of Rails framework to provide Object-relational mapping (ORM) functionalities.</p>\r\n<h3>1.2.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Active Record</h3>\r\n<p>Active record is an architectural pattern used to manage data in relational databases through objects. In Ruby on Rails the Active Record module provides object-relational mapping to classes. This module builds the Model layer that connects the database tables with its representation in ruby classes. Rails provide tools to implement the CRUD functionality with zero-configuration. CRUD allows creating, reading, updating and deleting records from the database through ruby objects. An object represents each row in a database tables. Additionally, it also provides advance search capabilities and the ability to create relationships or associations between models. Active Records relies heavily on conventions on how the classes should be named, the tables in the database, the foreign keys and primary keys. However, the database mapping can be accomplished using configuration, but it is highly encouraged to follow the rails convention, such as active record modules.</p>\r\n<p>This modules is used to create model classes, which contains the business logic, handle validations and relationships, automatically maps to a table and encapsulates data access, provides getters and setters, callbacks and also supports several databases.</p>\r\n<h3>1.2.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Active Resource</h3>\r\n<p>Active Resource module is used for managing the connection between RESTful web services and business objects. It follows the same principle of Active Record that is to reduce the amount of code needed to map resources. Active Resources maps model classes to remote REST resources in the same way that Active Record maps model classes to database tables. Active Resource leverages the HTTP protocol and adds code conventions to make it easy to infer complex structures and relations. Active Record also provides proxy capabilities between an Active Resource (client) and a RESTful service. This is accomplished implementing an object-relational mapping for REST web services. When a request to a remote resource is made, a REST XML is generated and transmitted, and then the result is parsed into a ruby object.</p>\r\n<p>1.2.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; RESTful Architecture</p>\r\n<p>REST stands for Representational State Transfer. REST is an alternative to web services, such as SOAP and WSDL. It relies in the HTTP protocol for all the CRUD operations: create, read, update and delete. RESTful web services are appropriated when the web services are completely stateless, limited bandwidth (it’s very useful for mobile devices since it doesn’t the the overhead of other protocols like SOAP), when the data is not generated dynamically so it could be cached to improve performance and when there is a mutual understanding between the service producer and the consumer.</p>\r\n<h3>1.2.7&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Active Support</h3>\r\n<p>It is a collection of utility classes and standard Ruby libraries extensions that are useful for the development on Ruby on Rails. It includes a rich support for multi-bytes strings, internationalization, time zones and testing.</p>\r\n<h3>1.2.8&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Railties</h3>\r\n<p>Railties is the Rails’ core code that builds new applications. It is responsible for “glue”-ing all the above-describe modules all together. Additionally, it handles all the bootstrapping process, the command line interface and provides the Rails’ code generators. Rake is one of the command lines used to perform database tasks, deployment, documentation, testing and cleanups. Rails also supply a built-in testing framework that generates test stubs automatically when code is generated, provides unit testing, functional testing for views and controls, test fixtures and supply test data using YAML.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Architectural Solution</h1>\r\n<p>The selected views to analyze this architecture are Module Views and Component and Connector (C&amp;C) Views. The Module View will contain UML diagrams which represent a static view of all the components, while the Component &amp; Connector View will show the UML diagram that presents a run-time view of a system's architecture: what components exist at run-time and how do these components communicate with one another.</p>\r\n<p>2.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Connect and Component View</p>\r\n<p>The Component-and-Connector View is a dynamic view of the system and presents the components, interfaces, connectors and systems. In the interfaces representation we choose to present the Interfaces as UML interfaces. This provides a compact representation of the interfaces and avoids crowding the diagram. The connector types will be represented as associations and connector instances as links to be the consistent with the UML notation that we are using the for the interfaces representation. In the same way the systems will be presented as UML subsystems.

Ruby is a dynamic scripting language with an elegant syntax and fully object-oriented. Because it is an interpreted language it is slower than other languages that are compiled like Java or C++. In most cases, this difference in speed is not a problem but when the web application needs to scale to millions of concurrent users this performance starts to degrade. The Ruby language is not suited for high concurrency applications, because it is not optimized for speed computing. It was designed to be elegant, simply and for rapid development. Ruby doesn’t have good thread support yet and, like many other scripting languages, Ruby has trouble dealing with long-lived processes. But other languages, like Java, are really good at that because they have been optimized for year to handle threads efficiently. Another weakness is the Ruby’s garbage collector is not as good as Java’s in that each process requires much more memory. In terms of deployment, a web application on Ruby on Rails could be harder to deploy than sites that are using more common technologies, such as PHP. That’s because not all the hosting providers support Rails, but in time the support of Rails is increasing.</p>\r\n<p>There are some kinds applications in which Ruby on Rails is not suitable for:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Static web sites.</li>\r\n	<li>Content Management Systems.</li>\r\n	<li>Sites that depend on large amount of existing code or legacy code.</li>\r\n	<li>Sites with legacy databases.</li>\r\n	<li>Multi-site servers, situations that require dozens or hundreds of websites residing in a single server.</li>\r\n	<li>Very large-scale web applications (millions of concurrent users) that need to deliver high-performance.</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>The Rails architecture sacrifices some flexibility in configuration to increase productivity based on conventions that are considered best practices. This could make experienced developers in other languages feel tied to things in “the Rails way”. On the other hand, Ruby sacrifices speed and resource management to favor elegant syntax, productivity and maintainability. However, most of the small and mid-size enterprise web applications do little computing and factors such as latency, bandwidth and database performance are not very crucial. These factors start to matter in high-traffic websites with millions of concurrent users.</p>\r\n<p>3.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Twitter case study</p>\r\n<p>A study case of high-traffic web application using Rails is Twitter. They started using Ruby on Rails but they reached a point that the scaling of their platform was not cost-effective. This was mainly because Ruby on Rails has poor multi-threading support. As in 2011, they have more than 1 billion tweets per week and 200 million users. In 2011 they reported [1], that are moving their back-end applications from Ruby on Rails to Java, which perform 3x faster searches and handle high concurrency better.</p>\r\n<p>As the Twitter Engineering team stated in [<a href=\"http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/05/engineering-behind-twitters-new-search.html\">1</a>] and [<a href=\"http://engineering.twitter.com/2011/04/twitter-search-is-now-3x-faster_1656.html\">2</a>]:“<em>As part of the effort, we launched a new </em><a href=\"http://engineering.twitter.com/2010/10/twitters-new-search-architecture.html\"><em>real-time search engine</em></a><em>, changing our back-end from MySQL to a real-time version of </em><a href=\"http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html\"><em>Lucene</em></a><em>. Last week, we launched a replacement for our Ruby-on-Rails front-end: a Java server we call Blender. We are pleased to announce that this change has produced a 3x drop in search latencies and will enable us to rapidly iterate on search features in the coming months.</em>” … And later… “<em>In April 2011, we launched a replacement, called Blender, which improved our search latencies by 3x, gave us 10x throughput, and allowed us to remove Ruby on Rails from the search infrastructure. Today, we are indexing an average of 2,200 TPS while serving 18,000 QPS (1.6B queries per day!). More importantly, Blender completed the infrastructure necessary to make the most significant user-facing change to Twitter search since the acquisition of Summize.”</em></p>\r\n<p>3.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Yellopages.com case study</p>\r\n<p>Yellowpages.com on the other hand moved from Java to Ruby on Rails framework. The rationale behind this decision is that they pursued to increase their maintainability, absolute control of URLs, no sessions, and be more agile.&nbsp; They have 170 million page views per month and 2.5 million searches per day.</p>\r\n<p><a href=\"http://www.brianburridge.com/2008/06/08/yellowpagescom-on-rails/comment-page-1/#comment-15463\">Brian Burridge</a> summarizes the process in the following way “YellowPages.com’s move from Java to Rails. They serve up to 23 million visitors a month. The conversion resulted in 20,000 lines of Ruby code instead of 125,000 lines of Java code, and most importantly eased the difficulty they had in maintaining it. Once complete, and optimized their site is now faster than before. They also completed the rewrite in three months with four developers.”</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1>4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Summary</h1>\r\n<p>Ruby on Rails has received widespread support throughout the software development industry, more specifically the open-source community. This support reflects, to a certain extent, that the framework was able to provide a fairly robust architecture somewhat consistent with the goals that the architect envisioned.</p>\r\n<p>The framework successfully exhibits must of its intended quality attributes. The responsibility of maintaining some of these qualities are deferred to third party components, as is the case of the performance quality, which is deferred to whichever web-server is configured at development or deployment time. The biggest strength of the framework is the way it leverages the Convention over Configuration and Don’t Repeat Yourself principles. This principle enables intuitive approaches when dealing with certain tactics to achieve some of the quality attributes. For instance, modifiability becomes less hassle due to the isolation or centralization of certain changes since the framework relies on default places where certain functionality should be located.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, Rails inherits some of the weaknesses of the language used to build it. More specifically, poor concurrency support hinders the scalability potential of an application built using Ruby on Rails. Furthermore, memory management is not as efficient as other languages available. For instance, Java exhibits a much better garbage collector behavior when compared with Ruby on Rails.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, it would be safe to say that the framework architecture meets most of its intended goals, but not without its caveats. The level and speed of adoption in industry and the open-source community could be used as validation of the potential the framework has, but at the same time we see limitations emerging when using the framework. Some of these limitations are part of the driven force behind the ongoing evolution of Ruby on Rails.</p>\r\n"

  body_value: "The extraction of Java-Swing GUI information using AspectJ seems like an way to do Reverse Engineering. The extracted information could be use later to migrate applications Java-Swing applications to the web, enhance program understating, generate UML diagrams and a myriad of other uses. This article will be summary of the paper about this topic [1].\r\n\r\nThe authors of the paper [1] are using aspect oriented programming (AOP) to intercept the application while is running and extract desired information. The information wanted in this case is the following ones: user events, windows and widgets. This type of reverse engineering is performed dynamically. The information is gathered while the user is using the application as usual. The more time the user use the application the more information is gathered. For this task, AspectJ is used. AspectJ is aspect-oriented extension created for Java programming language. AspectJ can interact with java-compiled code (bytecode) and it intercepts specific function calls.  For instance to extract windows and widget the aspect code will detect the Java-Swing calls of: “showFrame()”, “setVisible()”, “show()” in the JFrames, JPanels and widgets. In order to extract the user events, the aspect code intercepts the calls to “JTextField.setText()” for user input in text fields and so forth. Finally, all the information extracted is stored in XML and then can be used for different uses: migration of java-swing applications to web, generate UML design diagrams, you name it! \r\n\r\nSomething about the title of the paper [1], it's that it mention web migration; however, in the content of the paper there are not depth in that topic. It only explain in detail how to extract information needed for the reverse engineering, but there is no detail in how to use the extracted information to do it web-enabled.\r\n\r\nReference\r\n[1] Samir, H.; Kamel, A.; , \"Automated reverse engineering of Java graphical user interfaces for web migration,\" Information and Communications Technology, 2007.

  changed: 1316629331
  body_value: "In this work [1] the authors explain the process of reengineering a legacy system in COBOL for object-oriented. Reengineering is a multi-step process to convert sequential and procedural-driven system into object-oriented and event-driven system. The proposed method [1] to accomplish this task is to transform the legacy system source code into an intermediary language: Wide Spectrum Language (WSL). The WSL code is used to apply an algorithm to identify the optimal granular unit for independent tasks taking into consideration factors as size, dependencies, and coupling. The detailed techniques used to determine the level of granularity are the following four: Determining Data and Control Dependencies (determine the dependency, if any, between data, variables, and controls), Program Block Identification (identify logical unit of execution of the legacy system), Individual Code line Evaluation (is the minimal granular unit of the legacy system: an code statement), and Procedure Granularity (is the largest self-contained granular units possible).\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, It’s a good idea to transform legacy system into an intermediary language. This way the process will be language independent. However, they should explain in more detail about the WSL intermediary language. And also, give more details in the transformation from COBOL to WSL and how it can be transform to OO systems. \r\n\r\nReference:\r\n[1] Millham, R.; Ward, M.; Hongji Yang; , \"Determining granularity of independent tasks for reengineering a legacy system into an OO system,\" Computer Software and Applications Conference, 2003.

This system provides personalized learning services, which aims to enrich the learning process and the satisfaction of the learners. In order to accomplish these tasks: the system perform open courses harvesting and identification, generate dynamically hyperlinks based on the learner experience and appropriated learning strategies, and present the content in a uniform presentation across heterogeneous content. National digital content repositories cross institution sharing of learning resources and universities open courseware seed the identification task. Web crawlers are used to harvest the open corpus. Focused crawlers, such as Nalanda and Combine are mentioned and Heritix is recommended.  The harvested data is later indexed to make it more discoverable with open sources solutions, such as Nutch and Swish-e and then retrieve using search engines like Lucene and Lemur. For the metadata classification there are 3 approaches: (i) extraction of the metadata from files that already have it; (ii) infer and generate metadata automatically. Semtag from IBM perform can do this using a Taxonomy Based Disambiguation (TBD) algorithm. Also Klarity and DC.dot are metadata generators. (iii) Use of social bookmarking (digg, flickr, facebook,…) to extract the metadata/content description.

The OCCS employs Heritrix (open source, web-scale, archival web crawler) for discovery educational content available in the WWW. Heritrix uses languages guessers (JTCL) and text classifier (Rainbow) to classify the extracted data. All the content is indexed in ARC files with NutchWAX and Hadoop.

The goal of the SSCF is to enhance individual bookmarks with shared knowledge of the community. It also presents how digital libraries can be combined with social semantic information sources and it exemplifies how these techniques can improve e-Learning. Digital Libraries and other open courses can leverage their potential with the collaborative architectures. Learners can use it to exchange information, and express and synthetize knowledge e-Learning environments. It also makes use of the social bookmarking, web semantics and ontology services in other to organize and classify knowledge.\r\n\r\nAbout this paper, I like the how it states the benefits of this e-Learning systems for companies and institutions and also the benefits web collaboration to boost learning.  Additionally, the idea of using social bookmarking to classify educational content is pretty interesting.\r\n\r\n[1]	I.

  body_value: "H. Dong et al. (2011) [1] introduce an approach to enhance disperse and heterogeneous industrial digital ecosystem for e-Learning. Its target is to discover and classify the industrial information automatically using focused crawlers. The focused crawler perform 5 operations: webpage fetcher (multithreading web crawling given a URL list), policy center  (fetching boundaries, max. depth, multithreading priority), webpage pool (store data as plain text), webpage parser (use heuristics rules on website layouts to extract desired data), service metadata generator (produce metadata and in ontology markup language), and service metadata classifier (used structured domains of knowledge to classify the data). [4] also explain in detail the Ontology Markup Language (OML) and perform several test and performance measures, such as harvest rate, precision, recall, harmony, f-measure, fallout rate, and more.\r\n\r\nThis paper provides a detailed methodology to perform focused web crawling of educational content. It also provides great details about the classification of the content using web semantics and ontology services. Examples of Web Ontology Language (OWL) are shown. Another thing that I like is the amount of metrics they have to measure the performance of the system. However, this project doesn't explain how the user is going to interact with the recollected data and the presentation layer.\r\n\r\n[1] H. Dong and F. K.

  body_value: "The advantages of different presentation media are explored in the work of N. Hashim and S. Salam in “Integration of Visualization Techniques and Completion Strategy to Improve Learning in Computer Programming” [1]. They compare the advantages of Mobile-based training (MBT) over Web-based training (WBT) for learning computer programming. Additionally, they explain some features that aid the learning process, such as visualization techniques and completion strategy. Visualization techniques refers to the use of static (images and text) and dynamic (animation, voice and videos) presentation. Completion strategy is an assessment technique in which the learner have to prove their knowledge gained. This is done by filling blanks of incomplete code snippets, rewrite programs to improve performance, and so forth. \r\n\r\nReference\r\n[1] N. Hashim and S.

  body_value: "<p>When you are programming you face challenges all the way. Getting the problems solved is just the tip of the iceberg, getting it done efficiently is the rest.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Why should you care for efficiency?</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Solutions to the same problem might take years with certain algorithm, and just minutes using efficient algorithms. For instance, if you have applications that are used for thousands of people over internet, every fraction of second counts. Therefore, efficient algorithms is a must.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>How I do my algorithms more efficient?</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">To improve something you first need to know the actual state. In this case you need to measure the actual effectiveness of your algorithm in other to improve it. It&#39;s very common to use running time analysis to measure the speed of algorithms independently from the hardware used (old pc, supercomputer it doesn&#39;t matter).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Run-time analysis</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">A common way to analyze the algorithms is using the big-O notation. The good thing about this notation is that is independent from the computer used to run the algorithm. You know that if you use a very slow computer (e.g. pentium I) v.s. a supercomputer use in NASA, the latter will run the program much faster. Big-O notation abstract the hardware and just focus in the algorithm per se. The only variable in the big-O notation gives the relative time needed to process an algorithm in function of the input n. Let&#39;s clarify this with an example.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Ex.1</strong> - You want to sort an array A of n integers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Depending in the algorithm used to do that you may have:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li class=\"p1\">\r\n		<b>selection</b> sort has a running time of O(n^2);</li>\r\n	<li class=\"p1\">\r\n		<b>merge sort</b> --&gt; O(n log n)</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">Right now, it doesn&#39;t matter if are not familiar with these algorithms (we will cover this the next lessons), the point here is that we have n integer and big-O notations give us a mathematical expression that is in function of the input n.

You&#39;ll see that n^2 grows much faster than n log(n). That means that the algorithm n^2 will take longer than n*log(n) to process as the size of the array n increases.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Common order of Growth</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">To give you an idea of the common order of growth of runtime expressions. Take a look at the following graph and table. The slower the function growth the better is the algorithm. In order from better performance to worst is:</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">1 -- log n -- n -- n log n -- n^2 -- n^3 -- 2^n -- n! ...</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-12-22%20at%203.22.12%20PM.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 306px; \" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/Screen%20Shot%202011-12-22%20at%203.23.45%20PM.png\" style=\"width: 300px; height: 257px; \" /></p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><b>Approximate growth rate from code.</b></p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">There are a whole theory and math behind the Big-O notation and other notations related.

  title: "Get Started with the web crawler Apache Nutch 1.x "
  created: 1328337152
  changed: 1328510301
  body_value: "<p>Apache Nutch is an open source <strong>scalable</strong> Web crawler written in Java and based on Lucene/Solr for the indexing and search part.&nbsp;It has a highly modular architecture, allowing developers to create plug-ins for media-type parsing, data retrieval, querying and clustering. [<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutch\">*</a>]</p>\r\n<div>\r\n	<u><strong>Motivation</strong></u></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	By using Nutch, we can find web page hyperlinks in an automated manner, reduce lots of maintenance work, for example checking broken links, and create a copy of all the visited pages for searching over. That&rsquo;s where Apache Solr comes in. Solr is an open source full text search framework, with Solr we can search the visited pages from Nutch. Luckily, integration between Nutch and Solr is pretty straightforward.</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	Whole-web crawling is designed to handle very large crawls which may take weeks to complete, running on multiple machines. This also permits more control over the crawl process, and incremental crawling. It is important to note that whole web crawling does not necessarily mean crawling the entire world wide web. We can limit a whole web crawl to just a list of the URLs we want to crawl. This is done by using a filter just like we the one we used when we did the crawl command. [<a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/NutchTutorial\">*</a>]</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	Some of the advantages of Nutch, when compared to a simple Fetcher</div>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		highly scalable and relatively feature rich crawler</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		features like politeness which obeys robots.txt rules</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		robust and scalable - you can run Nutch on a cluster of 100 machines</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		quality - you can bias the crawling to fetch &ldquo;important&rdquo; pages first</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><u><strong>Basics about Nutch</strong></u></p>\r\n<p>First you need to know that, Nutch data is composed of:</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		The crawl database, or <strong>crawldb</strong>. This contains information about every url known to Nutch, including whether it was fetched, and, if so, when.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		The link database, or <strong>linkdb</strong>. This contains the list of known links to each url, including both the source url and anchor text of the link.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		A set of <strong>segments</strong>. Each segment is a set of urls that are fetched as a unit. Segments are directories with the following subdirectories:</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<strong>crawl_generate</strong> names a set of urls to be fetche</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<strong>crawl_fetch</strong> contains the status of fetching each url</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<strong>content</strong> contains the raw content retrieved from each url</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<strong>parse_text</strong> contains the parsed text of each url</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<strong>parse_data</strong> contains outlinks and metadata parsed from each url</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		<strong>crawl_parse</strong> contains the outlink urls, used to update the crawldb</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p><u><strong>Nutch and Hadoop</strong></u></p>\r\n<p>As of the official Nutch 1.3 release the source code architecture has been greatly simplified to allow us to run Nutch in one of two modes; namely local and deploy. By default, Nutch no longer comes with a Hadoop distribution, however when run in local mode e.g. running Nutch in a single process on one machine, then we use Hadoop as a dependency. This may suit you fine if you have a small site to crawl and index, but most people choose Nutch because of its capability to run on in deploy mode, within a Hadoop cluster. This gives you the benefit of a distributed file system (HDFS) and MapReduce processing style. &nbsp;If you are interested in deployed mode <a href=\"http://wiki.apache.org/nutch/NutchHadoopTutorial\">read here</a>.</p>\r\n<p><u><strong>Getting hands dirt with Nutch</strong></u></p>\r\n<p><strong>1 Setup Nutch from binary distribution</strong></p>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Unzip your binary Nutch package to $HOME/nutch-1.3</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		cd $HOME/nutch-1.3/runtime/local</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		From now on, we are going to use ${NUTCH_RUNTIME_HOME} to refer to the current directory.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<strong>2. Verify your Nutch installation</strong></div>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n		run &quot;bin/nutch&quot;</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		You can confirm a correct installation if you seeing the following: &nbsp;Usage: nutch [-core] COMMAND</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<div>\r\n	<u>Some troubleshooting tips:</u></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	Run the following command if you are seeing &quot;Permission denied&quot;:</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	chmod +x bin/nutch</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	Setup JAVA_HOME if you are seeing JAVA_HOME not set. On Mac, you can run the following command or add it to ~/.bashrc:</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Versions/1.6/Home #mac</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	Ubuntu:</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.6.0-openjdk&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	export NUTCH_HOME=/var/www/nutch-1.3/runtime/local</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	<u>Example of using Nutch to crawl wikipedia pages:</u></div>\r\n<div>\r\n	Here we are try to crawl&nbsp;<span class=\"s2\"><a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence</a>&nbsp;and sublinks in the same domain.</span></div>\r\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\r\n	<li class=\"li1\">\r\n		$ cd NUTCH_HOME/runtime/local</li>\r\n	<li class=\"li2\">\r\n		<span class=\"s1\">$ echo &quot;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence\"><span class=\"s2\">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collective_intelligence</span></a>&quot;

  body_value: "<p>When you are coding in a team enviroment it&#39;s good to have the subversion properties in your files, that way any other developer can see quickly who made the last changes and when.</p>\r\n<p>You can add the following lines at the bottom of your code:</p>\r\n<div>\r\n	//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;REVISION HISTORY</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$LastChangedDate: $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$Revision: $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$LastChangedBy: $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$Id: $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	And when you perform your svn commit will be automatically populated something like this:</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;REVISION HISTORY</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$LastChangedDate: 2012-02-11 18:24:39 -0500 (Sat, 11 Feb 2012) $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$Revision: 61 $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$LastChangedBy: adriansky $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	// &nbsp;$Id: Heap.java 61 2012-02-11 23:24:39Z adriansky $</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	//-----------------------------------------------------------------------------</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	&nbsp;</div>\r\n<div>\r\n	Also you need to set the SVN properties for that file. The Properties that you need are the following:</div>\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>\r\n		svn:eol-style &nbsp;---&gt; LF</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		svn:keywords ---&gt; LastChangedDate Revision LastChangedBy Id</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<div>\r\n	If you are using Eclipse you can edit it following this steps:</div>\r\n<ol>\r\n	<li>\r\n		right click file you want to add svn properties</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Menu team &gt; set properties (image bellow)</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Select the Property name from the combobox&nbsp;(image bellow)</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Add the text property in the text box&nbsp;(image bellow)</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		You can also use files to avoid all the typing every time. right click and &#39;save as...&#39; to &lt;<a href=\"/sites/default/files/svn-keywords.txt\" target=\"_blank\">svn-keywords</a>&gt; and&nbsp;&lt;<a href=\"/sites/default/files/svn-eol-style.txt\" onclick=\"window.open(this.href, '', 'resizable=no,status=no,location=no,toolbar=no,menubar=no,fullscreen=no,scrollbars=no,dependent=no'); return false;\">svn-eol-property</a>&gt;.</li>\r\n	<li>\r\n		Commit and you are all set.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>Eclipse Menu to add svn properties</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"Eclipse SVN Property Menu\" src=\"/sites/default/files/svnprop1.png\" style=\"width: 600px; height: 564px; \" /></p>\r\n<p>Adding SVN properties typing</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"/sites/default/files/svnprop2.png\" style=\"width: 525px; height: 520px; \" /></p>\r\n<p>Adding SVN property from file</p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"SVN property from file\" src=\"/sites/default/files/svnprop3.png\" style=\"width: 525px; height: 520px; \" /></p>\r\n"
